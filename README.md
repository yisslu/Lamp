# ðŸ’¡ Simple Lamp App

**Simple Lamp App** is a basic iOS application that simulates turning a lamp on and off. When the lamp button is pressed, the background color toggles between black (off) and white (on), mimicking a flashlight effect.

This app was built using **UIKit with Storyboards**, making it ideal as a beginner project to learn interface building and simple state toggling in iOS.
